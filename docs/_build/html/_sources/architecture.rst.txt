Compatible Systems
==================

To manage a server automatically, Netmaker requires **systemd-based linux.** Compatible systems include:
        - Fedora
        - Ubuntu
        - Debian
        - Mint
        - SUSE
        - RHEL
        - Raspian.
        - Arch
        - CentOS
        - CoreOS
      
To manage DNS (optional), the server must have systemd-resolved. Systems that have this enabled include:
        - Arch
        - Debian
        - Ubuntu
        - SUSE


In future releases, we will support other platforms such as Windows, MacOS, iOS, Android, and more.
